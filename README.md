# Profile of Talent Projects Based on Knowledge Graphs
+ Constructed a basic dataset profiling authoritative talent projects in China (*Chang Jiang Scholars Program*, *National Science Fund for Distinguished/Excellent Young Scholars*, etc.) by crawling information concerning 14,969 scholars, including domain affiliations, annual citations, coauthor relationships, and institutional migrations
+ Retrieved award lists from National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health for proposing a rank about institutes and enterprises according to Federal investments and principle investigators
+ Derived coauthor relationships to evaluate the clustering effect of institutes in various fields
+ Derived *Turing Indexes* for individual projects and awards as a reference for committees to filter applicants
